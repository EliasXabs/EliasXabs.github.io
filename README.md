This is my third version of my website however this version I'll be taking courses alongside this course so the progress might be slow however I'll get there.

This version will be using HTML for now later on I'll be adding other technologies and languages in order to improve the website.

My goal for this website is to show my projects in an organized manner and eye pleasing.
